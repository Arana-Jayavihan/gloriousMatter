Software Quality Assurance (SQA) is a systematic process that ensures software meets specified requirements and standards by focusing on both defect prevention and detection. It involves activities such as requirements analysis, design control, code reviews, testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance), and risk management. SQA relies on industry standards like ISO/IEC 25010 and uses tools for automation, defect tracking, and version control. Best practices include adopting test-driven development, automating tests, using quality metrics, and maintaining clear documentation to produce reliable, high-quality software that meets both functional and non-functional needs.
